âœ… Earnings patterns by platform, category, and experience

âœ… Job success rates, rehire rates, and client ratings across different groups

âœ… Geographic insights into freelancer opportunities

âœ… Jobs distribution by experience level across platforms


The analysis was conducted in Tableau, with supplementary data processing in Excel. The final output is an interactive dashboard featuring:

KPIs highlighting total freelancers, total earnings, and market spend

Actionable recommendations for freelancers, clients, and platforms
